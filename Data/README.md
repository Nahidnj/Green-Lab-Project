## üìã Column Descriptions

| **Column Name**          | **Data Type** | **Description**                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Task`                   | `object`      | The type of NLP task performed (e.g., classification, sentiment analysis, question answering).  |
| `Prompt`                 | `object`      | The specific input or instruction provided to the model.                                        |
| `Model`                  | `object`      | The LLM used for inference (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-2b-it, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3).         |
| `Response`               | `object`      | The output generated by the model in response to the given prompt.                              |
| `Duration (s)`           | `float64`     | The time taken for the model to process the input and generate a response, in seconds.          |
| `GPU Utilization (%)`    | `float64`     | The percentage of GPU resources utilized during the inference.                                  |
| `GPU Power (W)`          | `float64`     | The power consumption of the GPU during inference, measured in watts.                          |
| `VRAM Usage (MB)`        | `float64`     | The amount of video memory (VRAM) used by the GPU, measured in megabytes.                       |
| `CPU Utilization (%)`    | `float64`     | The percentage of CPU resources utilized during the inference.                                  |
| `CPU Power (j)`          | `float64`     | The energy consumption of the CPU during inference, measured in joules.                        |
